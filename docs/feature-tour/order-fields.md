# Order Fields
Snipcart supports custom fields for products and _orders_. Commonly-used [order fields](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/configuration/custom-fields#order-custom-fields) are comments for the store and gift notes. While you can add whatever order fields you might want, the Snipcart plugin offers settings for these so that...

1. You can just provide field names and use the included cart JS tag to have them added as text fields in your checkout flow.
2. These fields will be used to properly send order notes and designate a gift note+status for orders sent to ShipStation.
